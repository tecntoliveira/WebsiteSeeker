Synthesizes and compresses accumulated memory files. Removes redundant information, updates summaries, and archives outdated content.

## Process
1. Read all learnings.md files across skills
2. Read recent-decisions.md and archive entries older than 30 days
3. Compress duplicated lessons into single entries
4. Update memory.md with synthesized insights
5. Prune eval score-history.json to last 20 entries
6. Flag any contradictions in learnings for user review

## Output
